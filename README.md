# Text-guided-image-editing-2024
Text-guided image editing on real images, especially in fashion for our case, where only the original image and a textual instruction specifying the desired modifications are provided as input, is a very general and challenging task.
It demands that the editing model autonomously identify the regions of the image to be modified while preserving the other characteristics of the original image.
In this paper, we introduce our system, which relies on advanced artificial intelligence models,
particularly models based on deep neural networks, large language models (LLMs), and specific approaches for image generation and editing (such as Stable Diffusion models and InstructPix2Pix).
These models enable a precise interpretation of the instructions and a coherent application of
the modifications while preserving the visual integrity of the image.
